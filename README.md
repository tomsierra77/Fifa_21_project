# Fifa 21 Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project is an analysis of FIFA 21 data, focusing on factors that affect player values and exploring predictive models to understand their value determinants. The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the application of machine learning modelsâ€”all performed using Python.

## Key Findings

- **Team with Highest Value and Lowest Age:** The team with the highest average player value and the lowest average player age is Manchester City, boasting an impressive average player age of 24.6 years.

- **Correlation with Player Value:** The player's value in millions of euros is most strongly correlated with several key factors, including:
  - Overall player rating
  - International reputation
  - Player salary
  - Potential

- **Regression Model Performance:** In the analysis, we employed various regression models to predict player values. The top-performing models include:
  - Gradient Boosting for Regression with an outstanding R-squared (R2) score of 0.985.
  - Random Forest, which also demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, with an R2 score of 0.979.

## Project Details

### Data Cleaning

We began by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency. This is a crucial step to prepare the data for analysis.

### Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involved feature engineering, transforming categorical variables, and scaling. We made the data ready for further analysis and model building.

### Exploratory Analysis

Exploratory analysis provided insights into the dataset. We uncovered correlations and visualized the data to understand the relationships between different features and player values.

### Machine Learning Models

We applied various regression models to predict player values and evaluated their performance. Gradient Boosting and Random Forest emerged as the top models, providing highly accurate predictions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of FIFA 21 data, focusing on player values and their determinants. By employing machine learning models and rigorous analysis, we gain insights into the key factors affecting player values.
